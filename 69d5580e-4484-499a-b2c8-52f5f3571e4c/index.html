We all know that resolutions don't tend to stick around. People stop going to the gym, they stop eating healthy, and they go back to living the life they were living before the new year began. Why does it happen?</p><p>They say that habits take twenty consecutive days to stick, good or bad. People have cheat days, they skip a day at the gym, those are all factors into what they are doing. I'm not saying that we have to go to they gym EVERY day but I am saying that we need to be aware of what we are doing.</p><p>We go through our days pretty mindlessly. Wake up, go to work, come home and veg out. So many of us have lost our sense of purpose or feel so weighed down by the responsibilities we have taken on. Why do you work so hard? I feel that a lot of us work so hard to keep up with our lifestyle. Our lifestyle is high but our funds are low, so we get so stressed and caught up in the rat race to keep it all together.Â </p><p>I have challenged myself this year to live far within my means. I have some catch up to do, some debts to erase and some bills to adjust. This certainly is going to be an incredible challenge, however, it is completely do-able. I just have to stay focused and maintain conscious thought instead of mindlessly swiping the debit card. I am going to attempt to use more cash in purchases so I can see the physical manifestation of money leaving my hand. Maybe it will create the idea that money is truly leaving.</p><p>I want so many things, I do. I have a vision of the lifestyle I want to have but I have to plan and prepare for it. I keep trying to push it into being, which only makes my predicament worse. This year I focus on money, not as something to chase, but as a tool used in exchange for goods and services. I am not going to view my job as a "have to do," but as a "want to do." I want to complete my job because it's teaching me valuable skills that I wouldn't have learned otherwise, I just happen to get paid to be there doing it. I am going to view my job as a school.</p><p>We are learning everyday. Why should I feel any different about work than I do about school? I am going to be there 8-5 Monday through Friday, just like school. I'm going to have to learn how to deal with all kinds of situations that I didn't have to handle the day before. I am going to have to change the way I do certain things to hit the goals that I am aiming for. I am going to practice and practice until I am one of the best in the company. I will have managers that help train me and coach me on new and better ways of doing things. Work is basically like school life and the people I work with are the teachers.</p><p>Yes, this year is the year of living with intention. I will write down my goals, I will thirst to get better. I will be far more mindful than I was before. I do believe that everything happens for reason, but we need to be aware enough to take advantage of our situations, whatever they may be. The journey is never over, so make every moment count.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">nathanryan</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
