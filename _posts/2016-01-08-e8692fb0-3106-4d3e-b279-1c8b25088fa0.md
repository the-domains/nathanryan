Everyone thinks they want an easy life. In all honesty, I thought I did for a while too. For the past couple months I have been experiencing it, and let me tell you, it's so boring. Unless you have an unmoving motivation for projects, hobbies, and other such things, it gets so dull that you don't even know what to do with your time.

I have realized that I love being busy. I like knowing that I have people do deal with, tasks to complete, and challenges to face. Even in life. I have also been in a lot of solitude, which I am not a fan of. I love people.

Being with people and interacting with them on any level gives me a feeling that I am human and can be social. Being alone has started to drive me crazy at times. I start to get depressed when I don't have human contact. Life slowly starts to feel dark, meaningless and it's not fun to try and deal with. 

I like to feel like I am doing something. Randomly, everything that I am writing is not fully processed and is flowing out of me in whatever form it takes.

Anyways, I want a life full of challenges. I want to feel overwhelmed. I want to feel the ups and the downs. I want twists and turns. The feeling of knowing that you are growing and becoming more than what you were a year ago is amazing. I am not the same as I was a year ago, I am so much stronger and wiser.

By this time next year, I have even more plans to be more than what I am today. I will look back and smile at all the challenges I will have overcome and I know for a fact that this year is going to be so full of difficult times. What is the weirdest part, I am literally kind of looking forward to dealing with all of them. I'm usually dreading difficulties only because I hate adversity in my life. Challenges seemed too overwhelming and I felt weak.

Something about 2016 is making me feel a strength that I have never felt before. I am telling the universe and life to bring it on. I am so ready for the challenges and curve balls. Nothing is going to hold me back, not even myself. I am getting out of the way and going with the flow. This year is the biggest game changer of my life. I know it for sure. It feels right.
