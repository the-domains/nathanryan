# Disneyland, the happiest place on Earth.

It was about a year ago that my family went to, The Happiest Place on Earth. I am a huge Disney fan, I want to be a season pass holder, I want to go as many times as possible in a year. I want to stay in the gorgeous hotels that are on the grounds. I want to go to see all the Disney Parks before I kick the bucket. 

I'm not entirely sure what it is about Disney that I love so much, but I think it could have to do with the wonder, magic, and imagination they bring to life. I notice that as we get older, all to often, our sense of wonder just disappears and people become dark, emotionless voids. We start to disappear into a world of darkness, hopelessness, and depression. Disney keeps child-like wonder alive. There is a sense of awe that I get when I go to Disneyland that fills me with wonder and hope. It reminds me that there is more to life than grinding from day-to-day just to make ends meet. 

I know this is beating dead horse, but we aren't here to just work, pay bills, and die. We are here on this planet to learn and grow. We get so caught up in what the media tells us we need, a fancy car, a ginormous house, a bank account that is overflowing. I will agree that some of those things sounds nice to have but I don't need all of those things. I want quality over quantity. I want know that I created meaning in people's lives, that I touched their soul, that I made them feel loved. Disneyland represents all those things to me. There really is magic in Disneyland.

The Big D brings families together, gives kids hope in a future, shows them fun. It reminds parents to slow down and take time to enjoy themselves. Stop taking life so seriously! Go to Disneyland... NOW!! Please take me with you!!
