Limitations are set within our own minds. We have the ability to break through any barriers as long as we remain tenacious and unmoving from our goals. That brings up another point, what are your goals? Did you write them down; if not, I suggest doing that. There are so many books written about how to be successful and I have read many of them. They are all in agreement that writing down your goals with a date set helps to push you. You can't just write them down in a book and put it away, you have to place it somewhere where you can see it everyday and visualize the outcome.

There are many books that also recommend creating a "vision board." The vision board is to place all the things that you want to come to pass onto. Let's say you want a new Mercedes, you find a picture of the Mercedes you want and put it on this board. I myself have not made a vision board yet, or written down my goals for the year... I'm putting off getting a planner. I also don't have the funds currently to get a board to make a vision board. Those things are pricey.

I have fallen many times into being extremely frustrated that I am not seeing the results I want. I have also realized that I don't follow the systems set in place for success and I think it's because I will feel like I am one of the masses. I don't know why following the masses to success is a bad thing, it would mean financial stability, regular vacations, less stress, more freedom to do the things I truly have a passion for.

We have to let go of ourselves and press on. We personalize so many aspects of our lives that aren't necessary. That person on TV said something that hurt my feelings, so what, are you best friends with them? Does that person, that you will probably never meet, really have that kind of power over your emotions? The only opinions that I believe should matter, are the ones of our elected officials. If there are people in your life that can affect your standard of living and they offend you, you make sure you use the power you have to at least fight it.

Our opinions are so shaped by the media that we think certain things matter. Our attention gets shifted into whatever facets they deem, which is incredibly frightening. If the media, as a whole, stared pushing less pop culture, and more world culture, or country culture, our country would be so different. We might have homeless off the street, veterans with jobs, children and families who aren't going hungry. Anyways, I'm getting distracted.

Look, all I'm saying is that we have so much control over where our life is going, and that's by getting out of our own damn way. Put aside personal feelings and go with the flow. You get offered a job you never thought would hire you, take it. There is an opportunity that might seem just a little too good to be true, do it. Sometimes they aren't fake, if they are, you learn to spot them through your past mistakes.

Life is messy, it has it's up and downs. I like to think of Ms Frizzle from the "Magic School Bus," she always said "Take chances, get messy," and I think I am going to adopt that as a personal mantra for my life. The only way we grow, is by taking chances and allowing ourselves to become a mess. These are the moments that define us and show us what we are made of.
