Success ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e9780b76-c240-445a-a6c5-b3e51111f954.jpg)

I have been known to quit because I am not successful. It gets too hard and I give up or it doesn't go the way I want and I quit. I don't want to be a quitter. I want to be a winner, successful.

I think I quit because I everything went my way when I was younger. I received what I wanted, I behaved how I wanted, but I still turned out okay. This is nothing against my parents. They did their best to raise me, and they instilled so much in me. My parents might not instilled how to handle adverse conditions, but the instilled in me work ethic, so much love, and a strong sense of well-being.

I suppose the quitting could be tied into my work ethic somehow. Now that I have said that I quit, but have a strong work ethic might not make sense. Let me break it down for you. When I am at work, I will stay till it's done, I will go in early to get a jump on the game, I will do everything I can to make sure that things work out. If I don't have a goal that I am passionate about, I cower at adverse conditions. Hear me out, this is all a just rambling on a page trying to work out my brain and how I truly operate.

I feel a lot of things. I am emotionally driven a lot of the time. There is one thing I don't feel, that is regret. This journey, that I am on, is mine alone. It's my job and life sentence to learn what I couldn't learn before, in this lifetime it seems like it could be persistence in a work place, a drive and a vision for the future. I have to let go of the things that I can't control and ride the turbulent waves to success. 

No one ever said the road to success is easy, and in fact are we ever truly finished on the road to success? We are ever learning and evolving. Quitting will no longer be a way out. I will tough out situations and figure out positive solutions to any problem. Unfortunately, life will make things difficult along the way, otherwise, I wouldn't learn to be stronger.

I recently listened to a great audio book. Michael Singer wrote "The Surrender Experiment," which chronicles his life journey to destroy the self and view life as a third party witnessing it unfold. Within his experiment, he lets go of his personal wants and opinions and literally goes with the flow, doing what others ask or need of him. His journey is a fantastic story about going from someone who avoided contact with people in the woods to a corporate executive, all by letting go and doing what is asked of him.

That is a dedication that I truly admire. His success found him, it wasn't always easy to ride the waves and keep his personal feelings out of it, but he learned the tasks needed and excelled. He found his passion that threw him into the throngs of success. Life had made him prepare himself by having him teach himself the skills necessary for his next destination.

I want to emulate that. I want to ignore my own hesitancy, fears, and ego. This new adventure that I am starting in the new year will be my surrender experiment. I am going to leave myself at the door and get the job done, I am going to pour myself into my work and learn the necessary skills to excel. Everything that will be asked of me will get done. I will take on the projects asked of me, I will lead when guided there. I don't plan on being perfect at all, but I am certainly going to put effort into it. Stress will not affect me because that is the self. My body will become a tool, I will just use it. My drive won't be for riches or a lot of money, my drive will be to be excellent and to climb the ranks goal by goal. I will start my new career with my own ladder of success. This journey will be far more mindful than my past experiences, and it already feels great.
