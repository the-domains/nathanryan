It's a New Start to the New Year

It appears that 2016 is quickly approaching, and I have found myself... again, with a new beginning. January 2015, I started a new retail job with a fancy title of Assistant Store Manager, but the pay was less than I had with previous retail employers. 

I did honestly take the new job, partially, for the title. The titles that we hold in our jobs do have some sort of power over where we land at the next job. I'm not sure why I have been granted a new beginning, again, starting in January, but I am going to take it and run like hell with it. It feels like it happened by chance, but there is something more to this new change.

I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and this is somewhat like a "reset" button for me. I have left behind apparel retail and will now be taking on sales. This is my chance to really grow into a more dominant person.

I have been complacent with many things going through the years and being in sales is going to help push me to fight for the things that I want to happen. I let situations, people, and emotions walk all over me in the past, but that's going to change. The year 2016 is going to be my year of strength, my year of personal growth. This coming year is going to be an important turning point in my life. I can feel a shift that I will be working my butt off to achieve. To the New Year!!!
