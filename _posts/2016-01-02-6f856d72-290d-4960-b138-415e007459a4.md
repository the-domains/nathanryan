Happy New Year!!

Officially 2016 and it's off to a great start!

Disneyland for New Years Eve was spectacular. I saw World Of Color, the water and laser show of California Adventure, it was magical. I felt so lucky to have gone to Disneyland 2 years in a row with the man I  love. We were standing in line at one point, I looked at him and said, "Remember how different we were last time we were here?" and we laughed and laughed.

Time changes everything. Our comfort level is so different from what it was last year. Our boundaries are shifting and changing and I think we can both tell that we are testing where the new ones are landing. We had so much fun together, but it wasn't all fun and games. There were a couple little spats that lasted about 5 minutes each, but we are getting over them a lot faster than we once did.

I appreciate that he is trying to do better and let go of things faster than he did before. I feel like there was a shift in our relationship. An understanding of him was born. I understand him more and tested it. I realized that I know how he will respond to certain things that I say, and not necessarily the whole thought. So, that was fun to play with.

His new-ness to Disneyland also showed, we kind of bounced around one park from ride to rid. We had no plan of action, we just wandered around asking each other if we want to go on whatever ride we were near. By the end of the day though, I realized that, in Disneyland, I have to take the lead. I will have to be the plan guy, inside the park.

Ultimately, this trip really helped us grow together. The conversations, the magic, the spats, and love I have for him, grew to a whole new level. I understand his personality far more than what I did before we left. It's true what they say; if you want to get to know someone, spend an extended amount of time in the car with them, and travel with them. You will get to know who they really are so much faster than in your day-to-day life.

I realize this post was all over the place. Thank you for sticking through it.
