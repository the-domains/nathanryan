Anxiety

Today I have an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. It's brought on by the unknown and lack of communication from other people. I don't necessarily feel that I need to know EVERYTHING, but I do enjoy getting to know at least what is going on. Honestly, I know that everything is fine, it's just my brain over-acting and building scenarios that are non-existent.

This has been a struggle of mine for a long time. I get into a frenzy over nothing. It could be brought on by my past relationships that were shrouded in secrets and lies. They really did a number on my head. I have been fighting these feelings and thoughts for years, and I get a little better as time goes on. It does become difficult when I am not social with other people and I don't have my own things going on that keep me busy. 

Maybe this could also be tied to being lonely. I don't really have a set of friends in my area. I don't have people that I can make plans with on a regular basis and blow off steam. As I have gotten older I have started to see the value of a quality friendship versus having a lot of friends. Still, it's not easy to build friendships when you aren't in a place of regularity. 

I currently feel a little lost with no support or input. I'm in this limbo of adulthood, which isn't all fun and games, I'll have you know. I don't know what's going on, I have a feeling that something is coming to change, but I have no way of knowing how to prepare for it. There is a for sure change around the corner and it can't get here fast enough, and I just feel so poor because my income isn't stable right now. I just feel like a mooch. Things are a lot different than what I would have imagined they would be a few years ago.
