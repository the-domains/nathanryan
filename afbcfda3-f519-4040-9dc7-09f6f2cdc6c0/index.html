If I didn't accept the job for fear of failure, I already failed.

It might not be my fantastic fashion-sense, it wouldn't because it's a tech company. It certainly isn't because I am silver-tongued, although I do wish I could talk my way in and out of things.

If I hired people based on skill alone, my stores would have been forever understaffed. We can learn skills that are taught, we can do everything we are told to become great. We cannot be something we are unwilling to work towards. I was a very depressed person when I was in high school. My mother literally called me a worry wart.

Struggling with your identity in high school is always a big deal, but we can get into it later. </p><p>I say I didn't have anything to worry about because I was provided for, I had want for nothing. But I did get to a point in my depression where I said, "This is stupid, why do I feel so bad for myself? No one else feels bad for me. Get over it and become an awesome, fun, and happy person. You matter!!"</p><p>It took a few years, but I won. It comes and it goes, but ultimately I have become so much more than I was, and this new opportunity is going to take me even farther.
